Additional Features

Feature #1
We added dropout layers to our CNN input model layer. This resulted in a solid in accuracy for our model by about $10,000

Feature #2
Our second additional feature, we changed to price range from 100k-900k to 0-800k. After taking a closer look at the spread of houses between the price ranges, we saw the a majority of the houses were within this price range. Afterwards we decided to filter out the zipcodes that did not have enough houses within them from our new price range. 


These are the two additional features that we added for this project.
